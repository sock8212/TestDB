The purpose of my database is to allow users to query and add information in a school system. It uses five sheets of pre-provided data that can be modified and queried as required. 
There are five tables: Courses (main), Enrollments, Students, Teachers, and Classrooms. When entering information, the input for the primary key is checked with two conditions: 1) is it an integer and 2) does it collide with previous keys?. If it fails either, the relevant error message is sent and it will repeat the process. I used a blob datatype as the pre-existing data was in that format, and was unable to be converted to strings/integers, which I would have preferred. I ensured that each query worked correctly by immediately adding them to the main interface after hardcoding them in, so it could be tested against the whole dataset for errors. 

Overall, everything is spelt correctly and has no grammar issues, and it returns legible data via print and can easily modify data through the relevant queries.
